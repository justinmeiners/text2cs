Converts text files to C strings.

Converts text files to C strings, usually to be included in another program. It's especially good for languages without heredoc syntax (like C and Haskell) and good even for languages which do, since you can edit them with syntax highlighting in another file and then use a Makefile rule to convert them into the format which you want.
